# Factorial between Groups Anova

> A **Factorial ANOVA** is used when there are **two or more independent categorical variables (factors)** and **one continuous dependent variable**. It tests for:
>
> 1. **Main effects** of each factor
> 2. **Interaction effect** between the factors



## **Purpose of the Test:**

To understand:

- How **each independent variable affects** the outcome
- Whether the **effect of one variable depends** on the level of another



## **Relevance to an MBA Dissertation:**

This is ideal for:

- HR: Testing how **department** and **training status** affect **employee performance**
- Marketing: Examining how **region** and **advertisement type** affect **sales response**
- Finance: Assessing how **investment type** and **market condition** affect **returns**



## **Case Study:**

### üßæ Title:

**How Do Department and Training Status Affect Employee Performance at XYZ Ltd.?**

XYZ Ltd. wants to assess whether employee performance varies by:

- **Department** (Sales vs. Marketing)
- **Training Status** (Trained vs. Untrained)
- And whether the **effect of training differs by department**



## **Hypotheses:**

- **Main Effect (Department):**

  ![image-20250714122826510](./../../images/image-20250714122826510.png)

- **Main Effect (Training):**
   ![image-20250714122850703](./../../images/image-20250714122850703.png)

- **Interaction Effect:**
  H0:No interaction between Department and Training

#### Dataset

 [factorial_anova_performance.csv](../../datasets/factorial_anova_performance.csv) 

**Variables:**

- `Employee_ID`
- `Department_Code`: 1 = Sales, 2 = Marketing
- `Training_Status`: 1 = Trained, 2 = Untrained
- `Performance_Score`

## **Graphical Steps in SPSS:**

1. Open the dataset in SPSS
2. Go to **Analyze** ‚Üí **General Linear Model** ‚Üí **Univariate**
3. Move:
   - `Performance_Score` ‚Üí **Dependent Variable**
   - `Department_Code` and `Training_Status` ‚Üí **Fixed Factors**
4. Click **Options‚Ä¶**
   - Move both main effects and interaction into ‚ÄúDisplay Means for‚Äù
   - Tick **Compare main effects** ‚Üí choose **Bonferroni** (optional)
5. Click **Continue**, then **OK**

‚úÖ SPSS will produce:

- Main effect tests
- Interaction effect
- Descriptive stats

## **SPSS Syntax:**

```spss
UNIANOVA Performance_Score BY Department_Code Training_Status
  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE
  /PRINT=DESCRIPTIVE ETASQ OPOWER
  /DESIGN=Department_Code Training_Status Department_Code*Training_Status.

## **Interpretation (MBA Level)**

A **2x2 factorial ANOVA** was conducted to examine the effects of **department (Sales vs. Marketing)** and **training status (Trained vs. Untrained)** on employee performance scores.

- **Department** had a **statistically significant main effect** on performance scores,

- ![image-20250714123547710](./../../images/image-20250714123547710.png)

  indicating that employees from different departments performed significantly differently, regardless of training.

- **Training Status** did **not have a significant effect**,

- ![image-20250714123613080](./../../images/image-20250714123613080.png)

  suggesting training (as delivered here) did not substantially change scores.

- There was **no significant interaction** between department and training status,

- ![image-20250714123633986](./../../images/image-20250714123633986.png)

  meaning the effect of training did not vary by department.

## **Business Value Discussion**

This factorial ANOVA provides actionable insights for XYZ Ltd.:

- **Departmental Performance**: Sales employees consistently outperform Marketing employees. This may be due to differences in job design, resource availability, or team dynamics.
- **Training Evaluation**: The current training appears **ineffective** in improving performance ‚Äî possibly due to content misalignment or implementation issues.
- **No Interaction**: The impact of training is **not department-dependent**, suggesting a **generic** effect across departments ‚Äî or a uniformly weak one.

This data should inform:

- **Department-specific strategies**
- A **review of the training curriculum**
- More **targeted interventions** for underperforming teams

## **Conclusion**

The factorial ANOVA revealed that **department** plays a significant role in employee performance at XYZ Ltd., while the **training program did not show significant impact**, and **no interaction** was observed. These results suggest that future performance improvement efforts should focus more on **departmental restructuring and training program enhancement**.
