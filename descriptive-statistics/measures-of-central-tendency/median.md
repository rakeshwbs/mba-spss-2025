## Median

The **median** is the **middle value** in a dataset when the values are arranged in **ascending** (or descending) order.

### Purpose of Median in Descriptive Statistics

The **median** represents the **50th percentile**, meaning **half** of the data falls below it and half above.

It is **not affected by extreme values** (unlike the mean), so it's useful when data is **skewed** or contains **outliers**.
